# kali-vnc

Kali's [base docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/kali-rolling) with XWindows and TigerVNC installed.
I've mainly build this to play with tryhackme.

## Open Points:
1. OpenVPN Integration for easy use with tryhackme
1. VNC Sound Forwarding / Stopping Stuff that tries to use sound crashing
1. Multi Target Build for Support of:
    1. OpenVPN & No OpenVPN
    1. Different DE's / WM's
    1. Different Presets of Kali Tools

## Contribution
I'm happy about every Pull Request which improves this :)
